Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to do:

    % cpan POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::CPAN::Info

## Manual installation

As a last resort, you can manually install it. Download the tarball, untar it,
then build it:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install

If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to run:

    % sudo make install
